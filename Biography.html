	<h3> Biography </h3> 
         <p> <font size="3">Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955 in Los Altos, California. His parents, Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah John Jandali, did not feel that they were ready for children, so they Put Steve up for adoption. Steve and Clara Jobs adopted him and raised in San Francisco, California. When Steve was adopted, his biological parents asked that whoever adopted Steve give him a college education. Through Steve's childhood, he was a prankster, carrying out many complex pranks. Jobs went to Homestead High school. When he graduated he entered Reed College, in Oregon. After one semester, he dropped out of his classes and began sitting in on other classes. Eventually he left and reconnected with his old high school buddy Steve Wozniak. Wozniak he designed a computer earlier in his life, and saw that HP had released a computer of similar design to his. He decided to build that computer and sell them with Jobs, thus beginning Apple Computers on April 1, 1976. A few years later Apple went public. Steve Jobs, who had most of the company's stocks, became a millionaire overnight. Steve is still a millionaire today. he still works as the CEO of Apple, but he gets paid one dollar a year, just to get the health benefits. </font></p>

	<h3>Individual in History</h3>
	<p> <font size="3">Steven Jobs relates to the History Day theme "Indivual in History, Actions and Legacies" because Steven set out alone to achieve this task and
	was forced to do that for most of his journey. Yes, he did have help from other people. For example, Steve Wozniak helped Jobs to form Apple Inc. the 
	first time. But, when Jobs left to form NeXT Step Wozniak was no where to be found showing that Jobs was able to do things on his own and support
	himself.</font> </p> </div>
