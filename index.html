      <h3>Thesis Statement </h3> 
      <p> <h2><font color="black"> <font size="3">Steven Jobs has created a great legacy in the technological field by revolutionizing the computer interface world. Jobs helped make the computer a fun and exciting new household item.</h2></font>

<div class="story">
	<h3>The Thesis; Explained</h2>
	<p> <font size="3"> Our thesis explains how Steven and his friends made improvements by developing software so users could have a friendlier experience with computers. Before Steven Jobs used GUI (Graphical User Interface) in his OS (Operating system) computers were boring and very complex and time consuming to do simple things. It took many commands to just see and use data, for instance, to find a name on a spreadsheet you would have to know several command prompt directories and the exact location of where that item was. Without Steven the computer may still have been what it was then, a complex device only worthy of being used by smart, computer technicians. Now computers are fairly easy to use with many different options based on color, size, abilities, and many other things. These can then be personalized even father onto the user file including desktop images, color, size, and more. Without any of Stevens great contributions the computer industry would not be the same.

	<h3>The Beginings</h3> 
      <p> <font size="3">Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak formed the Apple company in April of 1976. In the fall of 1979, Jobs was with a group of executives taking a tour of the Xerox Research Center. This is where he got the idea for the first ever apple computer that used a mouse. This new computer was called the Apple Lisa. This computer wasn't successful. Eventually he began pouring major amounts of money to produce the Macintosh. It was the first ever computer to use a graphical user interface (GUI), a feature that allowed people to run commands by pointing on things or clicking instead of typing instructions. After the second computer released by Apple their was a internal power struggle and Jobs was later relieved of his duties and no longer the CEO of Apple. Thus is when he formed NeXT. Once NeXT was functional they release the NeXT Workstation, a highly technological machine that was very expensive. However this computer failed, the industry labeled it as cost-prohibitive. After some more creations from NeXT in 1996, Apple announced its purchase of NeXT for a total price of $429 Million. The deal was finalized in the end of 1996, bringing Jobs back to the same company he founded 13 years earlier.

	<h3>The climax of his Career</h3>
<p>
He soon after became Apple's interim CEO after the board of directors lost confidence in their current one in a boardroom fight. 
In early 1998 Jobs immediately cut some of the current Apple projects that were highly wasteful of money. 
With the purchase of NeXT came all of the projects it had been working on or had published. 
One of these was NeXTSTEP, which evolved into the Mac OS X (Operating system). Under Jobs' guidance the company soared and had increased sales with the introduction of the iMac and many other new products. 
At the 2000 Macworld Expo, Jobs officially dropped the "interim" modifier from his title at Apple thus making him a Permanent CEO. 
Jobs joked at the time saying he would call himself the "iCEO". 
In 2001, Steve Jobs was granted stock options in the amount of 7,500,000 shares of Apple with a price of $18.30, which allegedly should have been $21.10 thereby making that have a taxable income of $20,000,000 that was not reported as income.  </p> </div>

	<h3> The Final Stretch </h3>
		<p> In recent years, the company has branched out. Developing new digital appliances and software. With the recent introduction of the iPod a portable music player, iTunes digital media software, and the iTunes Store The company made an entry into the consumer electronics and music distribution. At the 2007 Macworld Conference & Expo Apple introduced its entrance into the mobile phone side of electronics with the introduction of the iPhone. The iPhone is a combination of a "iPod, Phone, and a breakthrough Internet communications device"(Multimedia). In 2005, Jobs responded to the criticism of Apple's poor recycling for e-waste in the U.S. by lashing out at environmental guru's at Apple's Annual Meeting in April. However, a few weeks later, Apple introduced it would take back iPods for free at its retail stores. Jobs still works at Apple but only for an annual sum of $1 so he can remain on the health care beneficiary list.
